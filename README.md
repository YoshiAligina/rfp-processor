
## Overview

The RFP Processor  analyzes Request for Proposal (RFP) documents to predict their potential value and relevance. It uses a combination of machine learning models, historical decision learning, and document processing techniques to provide intelligent insights. This was made FOR QUEST DIAGNOSTICS CLIFTON when I was an intern. I was granted permisson to upload this to GitHub with company data scrubbed. 

## Complete Processing Workflow

### 1. Document Upload & File Handling

**Entry Point:** User uploads files through the "Upload & Process" tab

**Supported File Types:**
- PDF documents (including scanned PDFs with OCR)
- Microsoft Word documents (.docx)
- Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xls)

**Process:**
1. Files are uploaded via Streamlit's file uploader component
2. System validates file types and displays success message
3. Files are temporarily stored in the `documents/` folder
4. User sees confirmation: "X file(s) uploaded successfully!"

### 2. Processing Mode Selection

**Two Processing Options:**

#### Option A: Individual Processing
- Each file is treated as a separate RFP
- User must provide title and sender for each file
- Each document gets its own analysis and score

#### Option B: Project Grouping
- Multiple files are treated as one RFP project
- User provides project-level information (title, client, status)
- All files receive the same combined score
- Useful for RFPs with multiple attachments or sections

### 3. Metadata Collection

**Individual Processing:**
```
For each file:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document Title (auto-filled from filename, editable)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ From (Sender/Company) (required)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Initial Status (Pending/Approved/Denied)
```

**Project Processing:**
```
Project Information:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project Title (required)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client/Organization (required)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Initial Status (Pending/Approved/Denied)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Individual file titles (auto-generated)
```

### 4. Document Text Extraction

**PDF Processing:**
1. **Scanned PDF Detection:** System checks if PDF contains scanned images
2. **OCR Application:** If scanned, applies EasyOCR for text extraction
3. **Direct Text Extraction:** If not scanned, extracts text directly from PDF

**Word Document Processing:**
1. **Paragraph Extraction:** Extracts text from all document paragraphs
2. **Table Processing:** Extracts and formats table content
3. **Text Consolidation:** Combines all content into structured text

**Excel Processing:**
1. **Sheet Iteration:** Processes all worksheets in the file
2. **Cell Value Extraction:** Extracts text from all populated cells
3. **Data Formatting:** Organizes data with sheet headers and row structure

### 5. Analysis & Scoring

**Three-Stage Analysis Process:**

#### Stage 1: Text Preprocessing
- Combines all extracted text for project-mode processing
- Chunks large documents for optimal model processing
- Prepares text for analysis

#### Stage 2: Base Model Prediction
**Model Selection:**
- **Fine-tuned Model:** Used if available (trained on your historical decisions)
- **Base Longformer Model:** Used initially or as fallback

**Processing:**
1. Text is tokenized using Longformer tokenizer (4096 token limit)
2. Document is chunked if it exceeds token limits
3. Each chunk is processed through the neural network
4. Chunk scores are averaged for final base probability

#### Stage 3: Historical Learning Enhancement
**Similarity Scoring:**
1. **Feature Extraction:** Extracts key RFP features (budget, deadlines, scope, etc.)
2. **Historical Comparison:** Compares against previously approved/denied RFPs
3. **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates similarity scores using TF-IDF vectors
4. **Decision Weighting:** Applies higher weight to approved RFPs, lower to denied ones

**Final Score Calculation:**
```
Final Score = (Base Model Score √ó Weight‚ÇÅ) + (Historical Similarity √ó Weight‚ÇÇ)

Weight Distribution:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ With Fine-tuned Model: 70% base, 30% similarity (for 20+ decisions)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Without Fine-tuned Model: 20% base, 80% similarity (for 10+ decisions)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Limited History: 50% base, 50% similarity (fewer decisions)
```

### 6. Document Summary Generation

**Summary Creation Process:**
1. **Sentence Extraction:** Splits document into sentences
2. **Scoring Algorithm:** Ranks sentences by:
   - Length preference (medium-length sentences)
   - Position preference (earlier sentences weighted higher)
   - RFP keyword presence (budget, timeline, requirements, etc.)
3. **Top Sentence Selection:** Selects 3 best sentences for summary

**Project Summaries:**
- Combines individual file summaries
- Includes file count and overall project description
- Maintains project context across all files

### 7. Database Storage

**Individual Entry Storage:**
```json
{
    "filename": "document.pdf",
    "title": "User-provided title",
    "sender": "Client/Organization name", 
    "decision": "Pending/Approved/Denied",
    "probability": 0.75,
    "summary": "AI-generated summary..."
}
```

**Project Entry Storage:**
```json
{
    "filename": "file1.pdf",
    "title": "Project Name - file1.pdf",
    "sender": "Client Organization",
    "decision": "Approved", 
    "probability": 0.82,
    "summary": "RFP Project: Project Name\n\nContains 3 files:\nüìÑ file1.pdf: Summary...\nüìÑ file2.docx: Summary...\nüìÑ file3.xlsx: Summary...\n\nOverall Summary: Combined analysis..."
}
```

**Storage Location:** Data is stored in `rfp_db.csv` with CSV format for easy export and analysis.

### 8. Results Presentation

## Error Handling

**File Processing Errors:**
- Corrupted files: Graceful error message, processing continues
- Unsupported formats: Warning message, skips file
- OCR failures: Fallback to available text extraction

**Model Errors:**
- Fine-tuning failures: Falls back to base model
- Prediction errors: Uses fallback probability (0.5)
- Memory issues: Automatic text chunking

This comprehensive workflow ensures reliable, intelligent, and continuously improving RFP analysis that adapts to your specific decision patterns and requirements.
